Over the couple of months ive been using Three.js and 

My goal for winter break is to actually get back into doing my work ive just been so drained since last year was a lot on me I get way too tired and fall asleep a lot. So over break I want to change that and get back into doing my homework on time. Its just been hard at home too many problems, but other then that I will also be using some of the new things I got from chrismas.
