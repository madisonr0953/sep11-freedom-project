### My Freedom Project Tool 11/8/2022

Beginning the freedom project I had to decide a tool that I wanted to learn and use in my freedom project. I decided to practice melonJS since it is a javascript that mainly focuses on creating games, and due to the fact I want to create a horror themed game and because of the different options of coding melonJS gives to me, it would only make sense to pick it. It is also an easier java for me to learn and practice with.
