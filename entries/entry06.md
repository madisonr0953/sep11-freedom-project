# Entry 6
##### 5/26/23

Expo :
Some takeaways I have from the expo are to be confident, me being confident helped me really make the judges smile and tell me good things about my project. Furthermore takeaways for my classroom is to really just not think about presenting because in the end you'll get that grade and no one's going to judge you.
