Three.js is the tool that I have been working with for quite a while. I will be using it to create a scary like game with a scene for my freedom project. Knowing this I focused on learning the properties I needed to help assist me in creating this game. Some of the things I learned when learning Three.js is how to set a scene, to set a scene three things are mainly needed one is a perspective camera which helps assist with how much you can see on the screen, this can be adjusted width, length and heigtht wise looking like this `const camera = THREE.PerspectiveCamera( 50, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, 2.5, 500 );`

### EDP
For the engineering design process I am now at the point where I can now use my gathered info to begin building/creating.

### Skills
The skills I learned while obtaining info for Three.js is the ability to gather important info, since I had to pick what I wanted to learn taking in those pieces of evidence. Furthermore I also learned how to process info as I needed to understand what I was learning and how to use it in my code.
